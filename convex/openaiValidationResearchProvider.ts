/**
 * Atlas Validation Research — OpenAI Provider
 *
 * Implements ValidationResearchProvider using GPT-4o to generate genuine
 * AI-backed research for each validation section.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - "use node" is REQUIRED here — process.env is only accessible in Node.js
 *    actions, not in Convex's default V8 runtime. Without this directive,
 *    process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY will always be undefined and the provider
 *    will silently fall back to mock.
 *  - Only instantiated when OPENAI_API_KEY is present and client init succeeds.
 *  - Drop-in replacement for MockValidationResearchProvider — same interface.
 *  - If init fails, the caller falls back to MockValidationResearchProvider.
