 * Rules:
 *  - No hardcoded invention names, product names, or acceptance-product references.
 *  - Every generated string visibly interpolates context fields.
 *  - No external API calls — this is a pure in-process mock.
 *  - Drop-in replaceable by any future provider (OpenAI, Claude, Research Engine)
