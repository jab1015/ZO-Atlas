# ATLAS-009_DATA_MODEL_BIBLE_v1.0


## Part 1

ATLAS-009 — DATA MODEL BIBLE
Version: 1.0 (Working Draft)
Status: In Development
Purpose: Define the complete enterprise data architecture for Project Atlas, serving as the implementation specification for engineers, database architects, AI engineers, API developers, and platform integrators.

1. Design Principles
•	Every data object has a globally unique identifier.
•	All objects are versioned and immutable once archived.
•	Relationships are explicit and queryable.
•	AI-generated knowledge is traceable to its sources.
•	Every inventor receives a persistent Inventor Twin knowledge model.
•	The system is event-driven and audit-friendly.
2. Core Entity Model
•	Primary entities include Inventor, Project, Invention, Inventor Twin, Conversation, Document, Workflow, Task, Milestone, Decision, Recommendation, Research Report, Patent Asset, CAD Asset, Manufacturer, Funding Opportunity, Company, Contact, Meeting, Notification, Specialist Team, Memory Object, Knowledge Node, Vector Embedding and Audit Event.
3. Universal Object Standard
•	Every object contains: id (UUID), entityType, title, description, ownerId, projectId, createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, status, version, tags, metadata, permissions, sourceReferences, confidenceScore, lifecycleState and auditTrail.
4. Relationship Rules
•	Relationships are first-class objects with relationshipId, sourceEntityId, targetEntityId, relationshipType, createdAt, confidence and provenance.
•	Supports one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many associations.
5. Inventor Twin Memory Architecture
•	The Inventor Twin maintains long-term memory across conversations, documents, decisions, preferences, goals, manufacturers, investors, prototypes, budgets, milestones and rationale.
•	Semantic memory, episodic memory, procedural memory and preference memory are stored independently while remaining linked through the knowledge graph.
6. Knowledge Graph
•	All entities become graph nodes connected by typed edges.
•	Graph queries support dependency analysis, recommendation generation, impact analysis and context retrieval.
7. Database Architecture
•	Hybrid architecture: relational database for transactional integrity, document database for flexible content, vector database for semantic retrieval, object storage for binary assets and graph database for relationship intelligence.
8. Metadata Standards
•	ISO-8601 timestamps, UUID identifiers, immutable audit records, standardized enums, confidence scores, provenance tracking, source attribution and lifecycle metadata are mandatory.
9. Version Control
•	Every revision creates a new version while preserving historical snapshots.
•	Soft deletion only; historical recovery is always possible.
10. Security Model
•	Role-based permissions, project isolation, encryption in transit and at rest, signed audit logs, least-privilege access and comprehensive activity logging.
Implementation Notes
This draft establishes the foundational architecture. Future chapters will expand the database schema, object definitions, APIs, synchronization, search, indexing, vector memory, recommendation engine, event model, workflow objects, AI department objects, permissions, data contracts, governance, and future extensibility.
