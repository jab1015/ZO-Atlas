## Purpose

This document converts the Atlas Automation Constitution into a concrete engineering implementation plan. It answers a single engineering question: **what must be built, in what order, to move Atlas from a guided workflow to an autonomous AI operating system?**

The Automation Constitution defines the principle: Atlas owns execution. This document defines the implementation.

**The goal:** Atlas performs every task it reasonably can before asking the founder to do anything.

---

## SECTION 1 — CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 How Atlas Currently Operates

As of July 2026, Atlas operates between Level 1 (Guided) and Level 2 (Assisted) on the Automation Maturity Model defined in the Constitution. The following describes the actual system behavior.

**Architecture Reference:** ADR-001 (Engine Owns Progress), ADR-002 (Three-State Readiness), ADR-003 (Configuration-Driven Journey), ADR-006 (UI Contains No Business Logic), ADR-010 (stageProgress as Separate Table).

---

#### Stages Live (1–4): Form and Questionnaire-Driven

Each live stage operates on the following interaction pattern:

1. Founder opens a stage
2. Atlas presents a structured set of fields and questions via the IntelliQ system
3. Founder manually fills fields or responds to AI-prompted questions in conversation
4. `journeyEngine.ts` evaluates completeness against `stageConfig` field definitions
5. Atlas generates a readiness score (0–100 internal, three-state external per ADR-002)
6. When sufficient fields are complete, Atlas generates the stage deliverable from founder-supplied input
7. Founder reviews and advances

**What Atlas does today:**
- Structures the questions the founder should answer
- Explains what each field means and why it matters
- Scores completeness against defined field thresholds (`stageConfig`)
- Generates stage reports and deliverables from completed fields
- Provides AI commentary, recommendations, and assessment within each stage
- Tracks `stageProgress` per stage in Convex (`inventionId × stageId` index — ADR-010)

**What the founder must do today:**
- Research competitors manually (Atlas does not pre-populate competitive data)
- Conduct prior art searches in USPTO/Google Patents manually (Stage 4)
- Supply market size data from external sources (Stage 3)
- Write or describe everything from scratch before Atlas can generate output
- Manually answer all stage questions — no pre-population from external research
- Re-enter information that overlaps with prior stages if not explicitly threaded through

---

#### Stages Not Yet Live (5–15): Blueprint-Only

Stages 5–15 are defined in `stageConfig` with `enabled: false` (ADR-003). The blueprints exist in `docs/STAGE_BLUEPRINTS/`. These stages are planning documents, not implemented features. Enabling one requires:

1. Set `enabled: true` in `stageConfig`
2. Add field definitions to `STAGE_FIELDS`
3. Implement any stage-specific AI generation logic in `journeyEngine.ts`

None of stages 5–15 have:
- Active AI research capabilities
- Document auto-assembly from prior stages
- Analytics integrations
- Automated background processing

---

#### Key Architecture Patterns (from ADR files)

| Pattern | File | What It Enables |
|---|---|---|
| Engine Owns Progress | `convex/journeyEngine.ts` | All progress computation backend-only; UI reads state, never computes it |
| Three-State Readiness | `journeyEngine.ts` → `ReadinessBadge` | Not Ready / Getting There / Ready to Move Forward (0–39 / 40–74 / 75–100) |
| Configuration-Driven Journey | `stageConfig[]` in `journeyEngine.ts` | One flag (`enabled: true`) activates a stage with no new routes or schema |
| Stage Progress Table | `stageProgress` Convex table | Stores per-stage field completion data; indexed by `(inventionId, stageId)` |
| Extension Point Schema Stubs | `conversations`, `documents`, `notifications` tables | Schema is ready; implementation is zero |
| UI Contains No Business Logic | All React components | Components render backend output only; no threshold or tier logic in component files |

---

#### The Founder-to-Atlas Work Ratio Today

| Task Category | Founder Does | Atlas Does |
|---|---|---|
| Research (competitive, market, patent, pricing) | 100% | 0% |
| Data entry and field population | 100% | 0% |
| Document drafting | 0–20% (Atlas generates from completed fields) | 80–100% (post-input) |
| Progress evaluation | 0% (Atlas scores) | 100% |
| Recommendations and assessments | 0% (Atlas generates) | 100% |
| Stage sequencing and unlocking | 0% (Atlas gates) | 100% |
| Background research before stage opens | 0% | 0% (not implemented) |
| Cross-stage data population | ~50% (manual re-entry common) | ~50% (some fields auto-threaded) |

**Summary:** Today Atlas guides and generates from what the founder provides. It does not research, pre-populate, or act autonomously before the founder interacts. The Constitution defines where the system must go. This plan defines how to get there.

---

#### Gap Register Reference

A representative end-to-end evaluation identified **52 specific gaps** across all 15 stages. The 14 Critical (P0) gaps are:

- GAP-A01: No physical product spec module
- GAP-A04: No price sensitivity testing (Van Westendorp)
- GAP-A07: No CPG "build from components" market sizing
- GAP-A10: No automated prior art search
- GAP-B01: No glass/CPG product design guidance module
- GAP-B02: No SKU architecture decision framework
- GAP-B06: No glass-specific prototyping path
- GAP-B10: No glass/ceramics manufacturing guidance
- GAP-B19: No IP Brief auto-assembly from Stages 4+5+8
- GAP-B20: No provisional patent deadline tracker
- GAP-B21: No public disclosure tracker
- GAP-B23: No automated unit economics builder from Stage 7
- GAP-B24: No value-based pricing calculator
- GAP-C13: No analytics integration (Stages 11–15 are planning-only)

These gaps define the implementation backlog. This plan prioritizes and sequences them.

---

### 1.2 The Automation Maturity Gap

The Automation Constitution defines four maturity levels:

| Level | Name | What It Means | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Guided | Atlas structures the process; founder does the work | ✓ Achieved (Stages 1–4) |
| Level 2 | Assisted | Atlas generates drafts from founder input | ~Partial (Stages 1–4 only) |
| Level 3 | Autonomous | Atlas researches and generates before founder arrives | ✗ Not yet |
| Level 4 | Operating System | Atlas manages the journey end-to-end; founder approves | ✗ Long-term vision |

**12-month target:** Level 3 across all live stages.

---

## SECTION 2 — TARGET STATE

### 2.1 The Future Atlas Experience

The target experience: **the founder feels like they hired an experienced startup team.**

When a founder opens a stage in the target state:
- Research has already been completed (competitors found, prior art searched, pricing benchmarked)
- Documents are already drafted (not blank templates — populated drafts)
- Data from prior stages has already flowed into the current stage automatically
- Risks have already been surfaced with specific action items
- Atlas has already provided a recommendation — the founder confirms, adjusts, or redirects

The founder's job becomes: **review, approve, and decide** — not research, write, and calculate.

---

### 2.2 Atlas Owns These Responsibilities in the Target State

| Atlas Owns | Implementation Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Research** before every stage opens | Stage `onOpen` lifecycle hook → web search API + structured extraction |
| **Document drafts** ready at stage open | Document auto-assembly pipeline from prior stage `stageProgress` data |
| **Calculations** (unit economics, break-even, TAM/SAM/SOM, margins) | Automated from prior stage field data — no founder spreadsheet work |
| **Competitive analysis** | Background research job → competitive landscape populated before founder sees the stage |
| **Prior art search** | USPTO + Google Patents API → results surfaced at Stage 4 open |
| **Recommendations** | Every stage surfaces Atlas's specific recommendation with reasoning and trade-offs |
| **Risk monitoring** | Patent deadlines, public disclosure bars, inventory levels, KPI variances |
| **Cross-stage data propagation** | All fields flow downstream automatically; nothing asked twice |
| **Document assembly** | Pitch deck, IP brief, sales toolkit, unit economics, landing page — all assembled from prior stage data |

---

### 2.3 The Founder's Job in the Target State

The Automation Constitution (Principle 9) defines the founder's irreducible role:

| Founder's Domain | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Strategic judgment** | Which market segment to target, which manufacturer to trust, whether evidence is sufficient |
| **Creative vision** | Brand aesthetic, product positioning, messaging voice |
| **Legal decisions** | All signatures, patent filing decisions, contract terms |
| **Physical world tasks** | Prototype testing, factory visits, investor meetings, trade shows |
| **Relationship formation** | Investors, retail buyers, manufacturers, influencers, media |
| **Negotiation** | Price, terms, equity, exclusivity |
| **Final approval** | Review and approve every Atlas output before it is committed |

**Everything else is Atlas's job.**

---

### 2.4 Required Infrastructure for the Target State

Reaching Level 3 (Autonomous) requires these infrastructure components that do not yet exist:

1. **Stage Lifecycle Hook System** — `stageConfig[n].onOpen` hook that triggers research and document generation before the founder sees the stage. Implementation location: `convex/journeyEngine.ts`.

2. **Research Engine** — Background research pipeline using web search API. Triggered by stage open events. Extracts structured data (competitors, pricing, prior art results) and stores in `stageProgress` or a new `stageResearch` table.

3. **Document Auto-Assembly Pipeline** — Maps prior stage `stageProgress` fields to destination document sections. Runs at stage open/close checkpoints. Produces drafted documents in the extension point `documents` table (ADR-007 schema stub already exists).

4. **Analytics Integration Layer** — OAuth-connected data ingestion from Shopify, GA4, email platforms, and ad platforms. Normalized KPI data model. Triggers automated performance reports in commercial stages (11–15).

5. **Risk Tracking Subsystem** — Persistent tracking of IP deadlines, public disclosures, and compliance requirements. Surfaces warnings across all stages, not just the one where the risk originates.

6. **Physical Product Vertical Configuration** — Product type field in Stage 1 that activates material-specific guidance modules throughout the journey.

### 6.1 Research Engine Architecture

**Implementation Location:** `convex/researchEngine.ts` (new file)

**Trigger Mechanism:**
```
stageConfig[n].onOpen = async (ctx, inventionId) => {
  await triggerStageResearch(ctx, inventionId, stageConfig[n].researchTasks)
}
```

**Research Task Queue:** Convex action queue with research tasks per stage. Tasks run in background (30–120 seconds). Results stored in `stageResearch` table (new, keyed by `inventionId × stageId × researchType`).

**Output Routing:** Each research task defines its output route:
- `stage_view` — surfaces in the stage's data view for the founder to see
- `document_input` — feeds into document auto-assembly pipeline
- `risk_tracker` — surfaces in persistent risk sidebar
- `monitoring_feed` — added to continuous monitoring queue (post-launch)

**Data Sources Required:**

| Source | Integration Type | Stages |
|---|---|---|
| Web Search API (Perplexity / Brave Search / SerpAPI) | API key | 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15 |
| USPTO Patent Full-Text API | API key | 4, 9 |
| Google Patents (via SerpAPI or direct) | API key | 4 |
| Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) | USPTO API | 8 |
| Domain availability API (Namecheap / GoDaddy) | API key | 8 |
| Instagram / TikTok / Pinterest handle check | Public scrape or API | 8 |
| Shopify Admin API | OAuth + per-founder | 14, 15 |
| Google Analytics 4 Data API | OAuth + per-founder | 14, 15 |
| Klaviyo / Mailchimp API | OAuth + per-founder | 15 |
| Meta Ads API / Google Ads API | OAuth + per-founder | 15 |
| RangeMe or Faire buyer database | API partnership | 12 |
| SBIR.gov / Grants.gov API | Public API | 13 |

## SECTION 7 — AUTOMATION ROADMAP

### MUST HAVE — Ship Q3 2026 (Months 1–3)

*Core automations that directly remove founder pain. Without these, Atlas is still a guided form tool.*

| Feature | What It Does | Effort | Founder Value | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **IP Deadline Tracker** | Auto-calculate 12-month provisional→utility window; alert at 9/11/11.5 months | S | Critical | None |
| **Public Disclosure Tracker** | Log public disclosures; auto-calculate statutory bar date; alert at 90 days | S | Critical | None |
| **IP Pre-Engagement Checkpoint** | Gating question before Stage 6 advances: "Have you filed provisional or signed NDA?" | S | Critical | None |

### 8.1 Metric Instrumentation Plan

**Required Convex Schema Additions:**

The following fields must be added to support metric measurement:

```
// Add to stageProgress table
source: v.union(v.literal("atlas_auto"), v.literal("founder_input")),
// Per-field tracking of where each value came from

// Add to documents table
reviewedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
source: v.union(v.literal("atlas_generated"), v.literal("founder_created")),
generatedAtMs: v.number(), // time from stage open to generation

// New stageEvents table
stageId: v.number(),
inventionId: v.id("inventions"),
eventType: v.string(), // "stage_open" | "atlas_research_complete" | "document_generated" | "founder_reviewed"
source: v.union(v.literal("atlas_auto"), v.literal("founder")),
timestamp: v.number(),
```

---

## SECTION 9 — IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES

*Permanent engineering rules for every future Atlas feature. These are not aspirational values — they are concrete filters applied in code review, sprint planning, and feature design.*

---

### Principle 1: Atlas Performs More Work

**The Rule:** If a proposed feature increases the work the founder must do — adds a form, adds questions, adds a step, adds a decision without first doing the research — it is not ready to ship.

**How to Apply in Code Review:**
- Review the founder interaction flow for the feature. Count the number of distinct inputs required from the founder.
- Ask: "Could Atlas have pre-computed or pre-filled any of these inputs from prior stage data or web research?"
- If yes, the PR is incomplete. Return for revision with a note: "Pre-populate [field] from [source] before presenting to founder."

**When Exceptions Are Acceptable:**
- The feature is a one-time founder input that is genuinely unknowable by Atlas (see the 7 irreducible questions in Section 4)
- The feature is a confirmation step for data Atlas researched — confirmation is acceptable; blank-form entry is not

**Passes This Test:**
- Unit Economics Auto-Builder: Atlas ingests Stage 7 quotes and calculates all margins automatically. Founder reviews a pre-populated model, not a blank spreadsheet.

**Fails This Test:**
- A "Market Research" feature that opens Stage 3 with a blank form asking "What is the market size for your product category?" — Atlas should be researching this, not asking.

---

### Principle 2: Atlas Reduces Founder Effort

**The Rule:** Every shipped feature must measurably reduce the time or decisions required from the founder relative to the pre-feature state.

**How to Apply in Code Review:**
- Estimate: "How many founder-minutes does this feature save?" If the answer is zero or negative, the feature is not compliant.
- Measure time saved in: data entry minutes eliminated, research hours eliminated, decision points removed, steps removed from the workflow.

**When Exceptions Are Acceptable:**
- Features that increase short-term effort in service of dramatically reduced long-term effort (e.g., connecting analytics integration requires OAuth setup once, saves 120 hours/year)
- One-time setup steps that eliminate all future repetition

**Passes This Test:**
- IP Deadline Tracker: founder enters one date (provisional filing date). Atlas automatically calculates all deadlines and sends all alerts. All future monitoring effort: zero.

**Fails This Test:**
- A "Launch Calendar" feature that gives the founder a blank calendar template to fill in. Atlas should generate the calendar from the launch date and prior stage data — not hand the founder a template.

---

### Principle 3: Atlas Generates More Finished Work

**The Rule:** Every document, report, analysis, or plan Atlas is aware needs to exist must arrive as a populated draft — not a template, not a guide, not an outline. The Draft-First Policy applies without exception.

**The Draft-First Policy:**
> Before any stage presents a blank field or empty document to the founder, Atlas must attempt to generate a populated draft. Even if the draft is 40% complete, a 40%-complete draft is better than a blank page.

**How to Apply in Code Review:**
- Review every document the feature produces. Is it populated with data from prior stages?
- If the document has any fields that could be pre-populated from prior stage `stageProgress` data, they must be pre-populated.
- "The founder can always edit it" is not a reason to leave it blank — it is the reason to pre-populate it.

**When Exceptions Are Acceptable:**
- Fields that are truly unknowable (founder story, personal vision, aesthetic judgment)
- Fields that require the current stage's output as input (cannot be pre-populated until this stage runs)

**Passes This Test:**
- Pitch Deck Auto-Assembly: Atlas pulls market research (Stage 3), product spec (Stage 5), brand identity (Stage 8), pricing (Stage 10), and financial projections (Stage 13) into the deck automatically. 80%+ populated before the founder sees it.

**Fails This Test:**
- An "Investor Deck" feature that gives the founder a 12-slide PowerPoint template with blank slides and instructions for each slide.

---

### Principle 4: Atlas Reduces Manual Typing

**The Rule:** The Research-First Policy requires Atlas to research before asking the founder to supply information. The Approval-Gate Policy requires Atlas to interrupt the founder only for irreducible decisions. Every other touchpoint should be pre-populated.

**The Research-First Policy:**
> Before generating any question that asks the founder to supply information Atlas could research, Atlas must first conduct the research and present findings for confirmation.

**The Approval-Gate Policy:**
> The founder should be interrupted only when a decision genuinely requires their judgment, vision, or physical presence. All other gates should be automatic.

**How to Apply in Code Review:**
- Review every input field and question in the feature.
- For each, ask: "Is this information that Atlas could find via web search, API, or prior stage data?"
- If yes, Atlas finds it first. The field becomes a "confirm or adjust" interaction, not a blank entry.

**When Exceptions Are Acceptable:**
- Information that is personal and private (founder financial situation, team equity)
- Information that is subjective and vision-dependent (aesthetic preferences, strategic priorities)

**Passes This Test:**
- Competitive Pricing Research in Stage 10: Atlas runs a web search for competitor pricing before Stage 10 opens. Founder sees a pre-populated "Competitive Pricing Context" table. No manual research needed.

**Fails This Test:**
- Any question that asks: "Who are your competitors?" — Atlas must answer this before asking. If the founder needs to confirm or add to the list Atlas found, that is acceptable. Asking from a blank slate is not.

---

### Principle 5: Atlas Increases the Probability of Inventor Success

**The Rule:** Every feature must connect to a commercial outcome. Features that improve internal metrics (faster load time, prettier UI, additional settings) are only valuable if they correlate to improved inventor success rates.

**Definition of Inventor Success:**
- Completing the 15-stage journey
- Achieving Commercial Readiness Score ≥ 80
- Reaching market (product available for purchase)
- Achieving a commercial metric milestone (first revenue, first retail account, first investor meeting, first unit economics model with positive margin)

**How to Apply in Feature Design:**
- Every proposed feature must answer: "Which of these success metrics does this feature improve, and by how much?"
- Features that cannot answer this question are deprioritized until they can.

**When Exceptions Are Acceptable:**
- Infrastructure features (analytics instrumentation, schema migrations) that enable future success-correlating features
- Trust and transparency features (honest disclaimers, ToS updates) that improve founder confidence in Atlas

**Passes This Test:**
- IP Pre-Engagement Checkpoint: prevents the loss of patent rights (irreversible commercial failure) before prototype sharing. Directly increases probability of commercial success by eliminating the most catastrophic early mistake.

**Fails This Test (needs reconsideration):**
- A "visual redesign" of the Stage 3 market research view that changes layout without improving completion rate or data quality.
- An "admin dashboard" for the Atlas team that has no founder-facing impact.

---

### 9.1 The Transparency Policy

**Rule:** Atlas must always show what it researched, what it assumed, and what it does not know.

**Implementation Pattern:**
Every Atlas-generated document, analysis, or recommendation must include one of three metadata annotations:

| Annotation | Meaning | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| `Atlas researched` | Data sourced from web search or API with source reference | Competitive pricing, prior art, market size data |
| `Atlas inferred` | Data derived from prior stage inputs or logical calculation | Unit economics calculated from Stage 7 quotes, break-even from projections |
| `Atlas assumed` | Data Atlas used without research or input — should be confirmed | Default market geography, assumed retail margin if not researched |

Every `Atlas assumed` annotation triggers a confirmation prompt. Every `Atlas researched` annotation includes the source. Every `Atlas inferred` annotation shows the calculation.

**Founder sees:**
- What Atlas knows and how it knows it
- What Atlas is guessing and why
- Where founder judgment is needed to override

This policy is required to maintain founder trust as Atlas becomes more autonomous.

---

### 9.2 Feature Evaluation Checklist (Engineering Use)

Before any PR that adds a new feature or modifies founder-facing behavior is merged, run this checklist:

```
□ Does this feature reduce the number of blank fields the founder must fill?
□ Does this feature pre-populate any field from prior stage data?
□ Does this feature conduct research before presenting a question?
□ Does this feature generate a draft document before the founder sees a blank?
□ Does this feature interrupt the founder only when a decision requires their judgment?
□ Does this feature include a transparency annotation (researched / inferred / assumed)?
□ Does this feature connect to at least one inventor success metric?
□ Does this feature comply with all 9 principles of the Automation Constitution?

If any box is unchecked: explain why in the PR description, or revise the feature.
```

---

### 9.3 When a Feature Fails One or More Principles

**If a feature fails Principle 1 (increases founder work):**
Reject the PR. Return for revision. The feature is incomplete. Atlas must do the work before the founder sees the interface.

**If a feature fails Principle 2 (does not reduce effort):**
Deprioritize. Document the decision. Revisit in the next release cycle when the feature can be redesigned to reduce founder effort.

**If a feature fails Principle 3 (produces a template, not a draft):**
Reject the PR. Templates are not finished deliverables. Atlas must generate the draft. Return for revision with populated content.

**If a feature fails Principle 4 (asks for information Atlas could research):**
Reject the PR for any question that Atlas could answer. Return for revision. Connect to the Research Engine for the missing data type.

**If a feature fails Principle 5 (cannot connect to a success metric):**
Formally defer to the backlog with a note: "Revisit when commercial impact can be demonstrated." Do not build features whose value cannot be articulated.
